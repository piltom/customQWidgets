# customQWidgets
Funky stuff to make a GUI fast using widget tables and keywords with pyqt5.
# Example
The basic usage of the module is shown in the example. There, a small gui with a table widget and a set of control buttons is implemented. This is done through creating a 2d list of QWidgets and special strings.
The usage of the config dialog class will be added soon

#Todo
Develop a way of setting properties easily, such as stretching factors, connecting signals all at once, etc...
